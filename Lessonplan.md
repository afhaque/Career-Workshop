##### Instructor Priorities:

* Do all that you can to emphasize that this session is critically important to student success. Let them know that during today's class they should put forward a concerted effort to fix as many of their application materials as possible. Let them know that knowing how to code is only half the battle, as it is equally important if not more so to have materials that document their skills adequately.

* Today's class is critical because students *need* to have complete profiles in BCS to be eligible for Career Services. 

* As instructors and TAs your two objectives are:

    1. Getting everyone's application materials into BCS and then immediately approving all who have completed materials.

    2. Providing students the feeling that they are being given individual attention towards improving their application materials.

* Prior to class, split your Instructor and TA pool into 3 groups. Two will be helping students with Portfolio, Two will be helping with GitHub pages, and Two will be helping students with LinkedIn and Bios. Each of these groups will be grabbing students 1 at a time in shifts of 5-10 minutes (depending on time). The goal is to work with as many students as possible. 

* This repository also includes a number of *great* examples of resumes. Links to strong LinkedIn profiles and portfolios can also be seen below. These can and *should* be shared with students.

### 1. Instructor Do: Workshop Introduction (5 mins)

* Spend the first few minutes of class giving students a primer on today's class. Let them know that they will be taking a break from coding today to work on the extremely important task of getting their career materials in good order.

* Explain to students that today you, your co-instructor, and TAs will be working with students 1 on 1 to help do a check on their resume, LinkedIn Profile, GitHub pages, and bio. 

* Also explain to them that in order to be eligible for Career Services, *every* student needs to have the links to these pages posted to Bootcampspot by the end of class. You should let them know that its okay if their links will continue to change, but they need to have their draft posted. During Winter Break, these contents will be further reviewed, and you may get additional commentary if anything glaring is seen.

* At this point, if you like -- you can also take the time to share the example resumes and Linkedin profiles provided. 

* Let students know that today is the only day solely devoted to getting these materials in tip-top shape -- so they should use it!

### 2. Instructor Do: Divide Class Into Pairs (5 mins)

* Have the class divide into pairs. While students are waiting to be helped with Instructor or TAs, have them look over each other's materials and give each other suggestions.

* It's important that Instructors really emphasize the importance of being open to feedback and criticism. It's better to get that feedback now and implement it than to wait until after graduation.

### 3. Everyone Do: Work on Application Materials while being helped (Rest of Class)

* Instructors / TAs should begin pulling students into corners or side rooms one at a time. They should then look over the materials and offer pointed feedback. Point out things like the below:
    
    * You need to emphasize your tech skills more!

    * You need to emphasize your projects in more detail!

    * You need to have better / more detailed readmes on your GitHub page. Employers won't know what your project is.

    * Your LinkedIn page should have a better headline.

    * You need to list out your education with more detail around the Coding Bootcamp.

    * Etc. 

* During these feedback sessions, do what you can to really help students prepare. As is the case with many of our grads, it's often the job application part that is more confusing than the code.

### 4. Instructors Do: Approve all Profiles (Post-Class)

* Take a few moments at the very tail end of the class to approve all student profiles in BCS. This is critical so they can advance to the next step in Career Services.
